Etch-a-Sketch for The Odin Project

Post-mortem
- Another excellent project. I spent a lot of time thinking about this project before starting, and as I result I think it went relatively smoothly. After figuring out the general logic of what I needed to do, sitting down to do each thing in order wasn't nearly as bad as I expected the project to be. Overall, I'm please with what I was able to accomplish with this project.
- I spent most of my brainstorming for this porject focused on the functions and JavaScript. While this resulted in a relatively smooth process for figuring out the steps to take to create the project, I found myself making a lot of last minute changes to the UI/UX. These changes weren't all too different from my original sketches, but they all required going back to fix, alter, or add something. I found myself going back to the HTML more than I had expected I'd need to. I think this is a reflection on my lack of design experience. I think this will get better with time, and I am pleased with how it turned out. 
- I found myself googling A LOT. I'm sure the code isn't perfect, but I've tried to implement lessons learned along the way. I paid a lot of attention to my comments, including a table of contents of sorts in the CSS. A lot of the JS seems relatively self-explanatory, but I guess we'll see how that  looks when I come bac kto review this project in the future. 
- The whole project was completed with just three functions and a lot of event listeners. The third function that I added,  selectControl(arg), I'm quite proud of as not only did I recognize that I could refactor it out but I also figured out how to reuse it with different arguments. This is something I've struggled with in the past, so I'm really happy with that small revelation. 

- Media queries done
- Completed styling for mobile-first design
    BUG: Despite this, I used 'mousedown' and therefore I expect it *likely* won't work on mobile
